The merch page prefers to serve images from the provided remote host by default but will fall back to these local files if remote hosting fails.

Remote image URLs currently used for the Sami tee:

- <https://sami.is-a.dev/IMG_2231.jpeg>  (was previously `imagesami.is-a.dev` — verify if that was intentional)
- <https://sami.is-a.dev/IMG_2230.jpeg>
- <https://sami.is-a.dev/IMG_2229.jpeg>

Local fallback filenames (place here if you prefer local storage):

- IMG_2231.jpeg
- IMG_2230.jpeg
- IMG_2229.jpeg

Use square-ish photos (600x600+ recommended) for best display.
