## Reporting & Redaction Guidelines

When creating **issues** in this repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Sensitive or special content must be tagged appropriately in the issue title.**  
  Currently supported tags:

  | Tag | Meaning |
  |-----|---------|
  | `ISL` | The issue contains content that must be redacted or kept confidential. Example: `Fix layout bug on header (ISL)` |
  | `IRE` | The issue requires immediate review or special attention from maintainers. Example: `Update security script (IRE)` |

- In the issue description, briefly note:
  - Why the content needs redaction (`ISL`) or why it requires immediate review (`IRE`).
  - Any specific information that should be redacted or addressed urgently.
- After the issue is addressed:
  - Remove or update the `ISL`/`IRE` tag.
  - Comment “Redacted / resolved” and close the issue.

### Why this matters

Using `ISL` and `IRE` in your issue titles:
- Helps maintainers quickly identify issues requiring privacy-sensitive handling or urgent review.
- Keeps the repository organized and prevents accidental exposure of sensitive or critical content.
- Documents that redaction or urgent handling has been intentionally noted and processed.
