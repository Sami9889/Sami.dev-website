## 🔐 Issue & Redaction Rules

When you open an issue, follow these steps:

1. **Every issue must reference a related number or identifier.**  
   Examples:  
   - Commit hash (`abc1234`)  
   - Pull request number (`#42`)  
   - Line number (`line 120 in index.js`)  
   - Feature ID (`F-07`)  

   > ❗ Issues without a clear reference will be closed.

2. **Add the correct tag(s) to your issue title.**  
   Available tags (you can add more if needed):  
   - `ISL` → Contains sensitive info that may need redaction.  
   - `IRE` → Requires immediate review or urgent attention.  
   - `DOC` → Documentation-related.  
   - `BUG` → Code bug.  
   - `UIX` → UI/UX improvement.  
   - `PERF` → Performance issue.  

   *Example*: `Navbar not loading (BUG, IRE)`

3. **Explain the issue clearly in the description.**  
   - Why it exists.  
   - What needs fixing/redaction/urgent review.  
   - Which reference number it relates to.  

4. **After the issue is resolved:**  
   - Remove or update the tag(s).  
   - Leave a closing comment such as:  
     - “Redacted / closed” (for ISL)  
     - “Resolved / closed” (for others)  
   - Close the issue.
